I'm an undergraduate at Brandeis University studying Computer Science, Gender Studies, and Economics and I'll graduate in May 2019. I serve as chairperson of the [Student Union](http://union.brandeis.edu/)'s Allocations Board which distributes funding to student clubs.

These days it's Computer Vision and Data Science which draw me in, and I'm always looking for new inspiration in those fields. This blog is where I share what I think is cool and what I'm working on.
