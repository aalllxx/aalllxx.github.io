MIT Interactive Dynamic Video
---------------------
This project uses video of near-stationary objects and uses the small vibrations in the objects to learn about how they move. It's very cool.

Handheld CNC Router
------------------------------
[Shaper Tools](http://www.shapertools.com/) has a handheld CNC router in the works. What I love most in this video is the contrast in size between the old mill and the new handheld tool.

Space Carving
-------------------
Thinking about Space Carving got me thinking about 3D modeling in a different way than I had before. It gave me a good model to think about how 3D works.

Reinforced Dirt
---------------------
I have been on a civil engineering kick recently. This got me thinking about the infrastructure I see every day.

Discrete Cosine Transform
--------------
This was the first time I thought about images as anything other than pixels.

SPORTLOGiQ Hockey
---------------------------
When I saw this video I was inspired to jump into computer vision in sports and build my [squash ball tracking program](http://felday.info/projects/2016/08/16/Squash-Ball-Tracking.html). I love how the program can determine loose puck recoveries, who contributed to goals, and other high level elements of a game.
