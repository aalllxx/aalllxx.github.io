I'm an undergraduate at Brandeis University studying Computer Science, Sociology and Economics and I'll graduate in May 2019. I'm chair of the [Student Union](http://union.brandeis.edu/)'s Allocations Board so I spend a lot of time meeting with clubs to get them funding.

The most captivating CS topics for me are computer vision and machine learning and I am always looking out for new ideas to get me motivated. This blog is where I share what I think is cool and what I'm working on.
