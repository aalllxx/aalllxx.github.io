title:  "Computer Vision Course: Udacity with Aaron Bobick"

This summer I learned a lot about computer vision from Aaron Bobick through his Udacity Course on the topic. He is a captivating teacher even over video and I want to highlight one of the most important lessons I picked up from the series. I didn't code all the problems sets and I don't understand everything about Fourier transforms, but I internalized a broad lesson that serves me well.

Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kiz9mgi1So) from the course in which Bobick shows an optical illusion which I've seen a half dozen times. A block casts its shadow over a grid of white and gray tiles. It turns out that the white tile in shadow has the same color intensity as the gray tile on the side.

I have always liked tricks like this and [gifs](http://giphy.com/gifs/3d-op-art-optical-illusion-3o7ZenrvPHmZEQLVkY) make for some of the illusions out there. Bobick's video isn't exceptional because he pulls a neat trick, but because he explains what is difficult in computer vision. It is so clear to the eye that that block is casting a shadow, but CV can't make assumptions like that. A robust CV system must infer very complex ideas in order to understand even the most simple situations.

Thinking about the unique elements in an image and what clues a computer could employ to understand an image - that is what I love about CV. That is what I love about Bobick's course.
