When I saw this video I was inspired to jump into computer vision in sports and build my [squash ball tracking program](http://felday.info/projects/2016/08/16/Squash-Ball-Tracking.html). I love how the program can determine loose puck recoveries, who contributed to goals, and other high level elements of a game.
